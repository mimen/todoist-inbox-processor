# Task Scheduler Feature - Authorship Map

## Document Creation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Documentation (First Session)
- PRD.md - Initial product requirements document
- User-Stories.md - Detailed user scenarios with acceptance criteria  
- Technical-Architecture.md - System design and component architecture
- Stakeholder-Questions.md - Key questions and decisions
- Task-Breakdown.md - Granular task decomposition
- Implementation-Plan.md - Phased implementation approach

### Phase 2: User Feedback Integration (Second Session)
All documents above were updated based on user feedback:
- Removed task duration features (moved to future phase)
- Changed to 15-minute navigation increments
- Updated to hardcoded authentication approach
- Added calendar visibility requirements
- Implemented two-step confirmation flow

### Phase 3: Technical Documentation (Third Session)
- Technical-Spec.md - Detailed technical specifications
- Implementation-Guide.md - Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Component-Templates.md - Reusable code templates and patterns

### Phase 4: Reorganization (Fourth Session)
- IMPLEMENTATION-README.md - Entry point for LLM consumption
- 01-CRITICAL-READS/CRITICAL-UI-REUSE.md - Emphasis on reusing existing overlays
- 01-CRITICAL-READS/MVP-SCOPE-DECISIONS.md - Final MVP scope boundaries
- 01-CRITICAL-READS/HARDCODED-AUTH-GUIDE.md - Google Calendar auth implementation
- authorship-map.txt - This document

## Key Decisions Made

### MVP Scope Refinements
1. Fixed 30-minute task duration (no adjustment in MVP)
2. 15-minute positioning grid with keyboard navigation
3. Hardcoded Google Calendar credentials (no OAuth)
4. Two-step confirmation flow (preview → confirm)
5. Calendar visibility toggles with localStorage persistence
6. Desktop-only optimization
7. PST timezone only

### Technical Approach
1. Reuse existing overlay infrastructure
2. Replace ScheduledDateSelector and DeadlineSelector internals
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing keyboard shortcuts
4. Side-by-side event display (overlap only when necessary)
5. Keyboard navigation skips positions without 30-minute clearance

## Document Relationships

### Requirements Flow
PRD.md → User-Stories.md → Task-Breakdown.md → Implementation-Plan.md

### Technical Flow  
Technical-Architecture.md → Technical-Spec.md → Component-Templates.md

### Implementation Flow
IMPLEMENTATION-README.md → CRITICAL-READS/* → Task-Breakdown.md → Component-Templates.md

## Primary Authors/Contributors
- All documentation created by Claude (AI assistant)
- User provided requirements, feedback, and scope refinements
- Documentation structure inspired by list-view project

## Version History
- v1.0 - Initial documentation creation
- v2.0 - Major scope refinement based on user feedback
- v3.0 - Added technical specifications and templates
- v4.0 - Reorganized for LLM consumption with numbered folders

## Notes
- This project follows the documentation pattern established in the list-view project
- All critical implementation decisions are captured in 01-CRITICAL-READS/
- The documentation is optimized for LLM consumption with clear implementation paths
