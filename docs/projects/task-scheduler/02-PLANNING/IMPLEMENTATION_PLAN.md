# Implementation Plan: Task Scheduler Feature

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for the Task Scheduler feature, providing a clear roadmap from initial setup to production deployment.

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Setup and Planning (2 days)
**Goal:** Establish development environment and finalize technical decisions

#### Tasks:
1. Set up Google Calendar API credentials
2. Create feature branch: `feature/task-scheduler`
3. Review and finalize component architecture
4. Set up development calendar test data
5. Create feature flag: `enableTaskScheduler`

#### Deliverables:
- Working OAuth setup in development
- Feature branch with initial structure
- Test calendar with varied event patterns

### Phase 1: Core UI Components (3-4 days)
**Goal:** Build the visual scheduling interface with mock data

#### Tasks:
1. Replace existing overlay system
   - Reuse schedule/deadline overlay infrastructure
   - Maintain props interface compatibility
   - Add keyboard context isolation

2. Build `CalendarDayView` component
   - Vertical timeline with 15-minute marks
   - Time labels on left side
   - Only show future slots for current day

3. Implement `TimeSlotGrid` interaction layer
   - 15-minute positioning system
   - 30-minute task block visualization
   - Available vs occupied position styling
   - Task preview on selection

4. Create mock data service
   - Generate sample calendar events
   - Side-by-side event display
   - Test overlapping scenarios

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Overlay opens/closes smoothly
- [ ] Day view renders 48 time slots
- [ ] Can select slots with mouse
- [ ] Visual design matches Google Calendar aesthetic

---

### Phase 2: Keyboard Navigation (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Implement keyboard-first interaction model

#### Tasks:
1. Build `KeyboardNavigationProvider`
   - Isolated keyboard context
   - Navigation state management
   - Shortcut definitions

2. Implement 15-minute navigation logic
   - Up/Down moves in 15-minute increments
   - Skip positions without 30-min clearance
   - Show 30-minute task preview at position

3. Add day navigation
   - Left/Right or Tab navigation between days
   - Maintain time selection across days
   - Loading states during transitions

4. Create help overlay
   - '?' key shows shortcuts
   - Dismissible with Escape

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation works without mouse
- [ ] Navigation feels responsive (<50ms)
- [ ] Help overlay documents all shortcuts
- [ ] No interference with main app shortcuts

---

### Phase 3: Calendar Integration (3-4 days)
**Goal:** Connect Google Calendar with hardcoded credentials

#### Tasks:
1. Implement hardcoded access (MVP)
   - API key/credentials in environment
   - Document future OAuth path
   - PST timezone only

2. Create `CalendarAPIService`
   - Fetch events for date range
   - Transform to internal format
   - Handle API errors gracefully

3. Build event rendering system
   - Display events side-by-side by default
   - Original calendar colors preserved
   - Show calendar name on hover
   - Calendar visibility toggles

4. Implement caching layer
   - Cache events per day
   - Invalidate on focus/interval
   - Minimize API calls

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Real calendar events display correctly
- [ ] Overlapping events are clearly visible
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with many events
- [ ] API errors don't break the UI

---

### Phase 4: Task Scheduling Logic (3-4 days)
**Goal:** Complete the scheduling workflow

#### Tasks:
1. Integrate with task update system
   - Update scheduled date or deadline
   - Maintain other task properties
   - Handle update failures

2. Implement two-step confirmation
   - First Enter/click shows preview
   - Second Enter/click confirms
   - No conflict warnings needed
   - Mouse can click any position

3. Add visual feedback
   - Task preview as purple block
   - Confirmation animation
   - Success feedback before close

4. Build date picker and clear function
   - 'd' key opens calendar picker
   - Shift+Delete clears date
   - Clear button in UI

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Tasks update correctly when scheduled
- [ ] Conflict scheduling requires confirmation
- [ ] All feedback is clear and timely
- [ ] Date picker integrates seamlessly

---

### Phase 5: Polish and Edge Cases (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Refine UX and handle edge cases

#### Tasks:
1. Polish animations and transitions
   - Smooth day transitions
   - Slot selection feedback
   - Loading states

2. Handle edge cases
   - No calendar access
   - Very busy calendars
   - Network failures
   - Timezone edges

3. Improve accessibility
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast mode
   - Focus indicators

4. Performance optimization
   - Virtualize long event lists
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Reduce bundle size

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All animations at 60fps
- [ ] Graceful handling of all edge cases
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes
- [ ] Performance metrics met

---

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Ensure quality and maintainability

#### Tasks:
1. Write comprehensive tests
   - Unit tests for utilities
   - Component integration tests
   - E2E test for core flow

2. Create documentation
   - Component API documentation
   - Integration guide
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. Conduct user testing
   - Internal team testing
   - Collect feedback
   - Iterate on pain points

4. Performance testing
   - Load test with many events
   - Measure render performance
   - Optimize bottlenecks

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] >80% test coverage
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] User testing feedback addressed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

- Monitor error rates
- Collect feedback via in-app survey

### Stage 3: General Availability
- Gradual rollout to 100%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Google API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, batch requests
   
2. **Performance with Many Events**
   - Mitigation: Virtualization, progressive loading

3. **OAuth Complexity**

### UX Risks:
1. **Keyboard Navigation Confusion**

2. **Conflict Scheduling Mistakes**
   - Mitigation: Require explicit confirmation

3. **Timezone Confusion**
   - Mitigation: Clear PST labeling

## Success Metrics
