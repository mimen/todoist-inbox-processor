## Key Achievements

1. **Basic List View Working**: Can view all tasks in current queue
2. **View Toggle**: Can switch between Processing and List views
3. **Inline Editing**: Double-click to edit with loading states
4. **Description Expansion**: Smooth animations for task descriptions
5. **Basic Keyboard Nav**: Arrow keys work for navigation

## Known Issues

1. **Limited Overlays**: Priority, project, label overlays only work in processing view
2. **Missing Shortcuts**: Most keyboard shortcuts not yet implemented
3. **No Sorting**: Can't sort tasks yet
4. **No Quick Actions**: Hover actions not implemented
5. **Performance**: No virtual scrolling for large lists

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **LV-010**: Add Quick Actions on Hover (complete, process, edit buttons)
2. **LV-011-014**: Integrate all overlays to work in List View
3. **LV-015**: Complete keyboard navigation (add j/k support)

### Following Tasks
1. **LV-016**: Port all processing view shortcuts (#, @, p, d, etc.)
2. **LV-020**: Add sorting functionality
3. **LV-018**: Virtual scrolling for performance

## Technical Notes

- Using existing overlay components from Processing View
- Need to ensure overlayTask is properly set for List View
- Focus management working well after recent fixes
- Loading states implemented for inline editing

## Recommendation

Continue implementing tasks sequentially. The foundation is solid but many features are still missing. Focus on:
1. Getting all overlays working (high priority)
2. Adding keyboard shortcuts for power users
3. Then move to sorting and performance optimization
