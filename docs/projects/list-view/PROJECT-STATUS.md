# List View Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-06

## Phase 1: COMPLETE âœ…

**Completion**: 21/28 tasks (75%)  
**Status**: Core functionality complete, remaining tasks deferred to backlog

### Phase 1 Achievements
- âœ… Fully functional single list view
- âœ… Complete keyboard navigation (arrows, j/k, all shortcuts)
- âœ… All overlays integrated (priority, project, label, schedule, deadline, assignee)
- âœ… Inline editing with loading states
- âœ… Multi-select functionality
- âœ… Quick actions on hover
- âœ… Sorting functionality
- âœ… Single data model consistency

### Deferred to Backlog
- Virtual scrolling for single list (LV-018)
- Mobile responsive layout (LV-022)
- Loading and error states polish (LV-023)
- Accessibility audit (LV-024)
- Test coverage (LV-026, LV-027)
- User documentation (LV-028)

## Phase 2: IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

**Status**: Implementation started with architectural redesign  
**Target**: Unified single/multi-list component with bulk operations  
**Approach**: Merging ListView and MultiListContainer into unified component

### Phase 2 Major Features

#### 1. Multi-List Sequential Display
- Show multiple queues/lists vertically
- Progressive loading based on viewport
- Each list maintains independent state
- Optional duplicate filtering across lists

#### 2. Settings System
- Preferences stored in localStorage
- Toggle multi-list mode
- Configure duplicate filtering
- Per-list sort preferences

#### 3. Bulk Operations
- Operations across multiple selected tasks
- Bulk complete, delete, assign, prioritize, label
- Multi-task scheduling mode (queue-based)

#### 4. Enhanced List Headers
- Visual indicators (colors, icons)
- Project/priority/label context
- Collapsible lists

#### 5. Right-Click Context Menu
- Quick actions via right-click
- Touch/long-press support
- Keyboard accessible

#### 6. Description Management
- Edit existing descriptions inline
- Add descriptions to tasks
- Show in expanded view

### Phase 2 Architectural Change

**Problem Identified**: Current dual-component architecture (ListView + MultiListContainer) causes:
- Focus management conflicts
- Keyboard navigation only works on first list
- State synchronization bugs
- Complex event handling

**Solution**: Unified ListView component that handles both single and multi-list modes internally

### Phase 2 Implementation Status

#### Completed âœ…
- LV2-005: Settings Data Model & localStorage
- LV2-006: Build Settings UI Component (Gear Icon + Modal)
- LV2-007: Implement Multi-List Mode Toggle
- LV2-008: Implement Duplicate Task Filtering

#### In Progress ðŸš§
- Multi-list implementation (needs architectural redesign)
- Load more button functionality

#### Not Started
- LV2-UNIFIED-001 through LV2-UNIFIED-005 (New unified architecture tasks)
- LV2-009 through LV2-020 (Original Phase 2 tasks)

## Current Focus

**Immediate**: Implementing unified ListView architecture

**Next Steps**:
1. Create UnifiedListView component (LV2-UNIFIED-001)
2. Migrate single list logic (LV2-UNIFIED-002)
3. Implement multi-list rendering (LV2-UNIFIED-003)
4. Unify keyboard navigation (LV2-UNIFIED-004)
5. Complete remaining Phase 2 features

**Key Documents**:
- [Multi-List Architecture Issues](../../../multi-list-architecture-issues.md)
- [Phase 2 Unified Implementation Plan](./Phase-2-Unified-Implementation-Plan.md)

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Phase 2 MVP**: 6 weeks (with architectural redesign)
- Week 1: Unified component foundation (LV2-UNIFIED-001 to 004)
- Week 2: Complete settings system (mostly done)
- Week 3: Enhanced list features (collapsible, headers)
- Week 4: Bulk operations
- Week 5: Context menu and polish
- Week 6: Testing and bug fixes

## Technical Notes

### Phase 2 Challenges (Updated)
- ~~Performance with multiple visible lists~~ â†’ Solved with load more button
- ~~Complex state management across lists~~ â†’ Solved with unified component
- ~~Maintaining selection state during operations~~ â†’ Solved with single state source
- Mobile UX for multi-list and bulk operations â†’ Still needs design work

### Architecture Decision
- **Chosen**: Unified ListView component handling both single/multi modes
- **Rejected**: Separate ListView + MultiListContainer (too many conflicts)
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, no sync issues, cleaner code
- **Implementation**: Gradual migration to maintain stability
