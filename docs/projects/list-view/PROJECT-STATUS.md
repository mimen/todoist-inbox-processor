## Phase 2: PLANNING ðŸ“‹

**Status**: Requirements gathering and scoping  
**Target**: Multi-list view and bulk operations

### Phase 2 Major Features

#### 1. Multi-List Sequential Display
- Show multiple queues/lists vertically
- Progressive loading based on viewport
- Each list maintains independent state
- Optional duplicate filtering across lists

#### 2. Settings System
- Preferences stored in localStorage
- Toggle multi-list mode
- Configure duplicate filtering
- Per-list sort preferences

#### 3. Bulk Operations
- Operations across multiple selected tasks
- Bulk complete, delete, assign, prioritize, label
- Multi-task scheduling mode (queue-based)

#### 4. Enhanced List Headers
- Visual indicators (colors, icons)
- Project/priority/label context
- Collapsible lists

#### 5. Right-Click Context Menu
- Quick actions via right-click
- Touch/long-press support
- Keyboard accessible

#### 6. Description Management
- Edit existing descriptions inline
- Add descriptions to tasks
- Show in expanded view

### Phase 2 Questions to Resolve

1. **List Loading Strategy**
   - Order of lists to display?
   - Maximum concurrent lists?
   - When to unload distant lists?

2. **Settings UI/UX**
   - Where to place settings?
   - Scope of preferences?
   - Default behaviors?

3. **Bulk Operations Flow**
   - UI for triggering bulk actions?
   - Confirmation thresholds?
   - Multi-task scheduling order?

4. **Visual Design**
   - List separation/spacing?
   - Header enhancement details?
   - Mobile adaptations?

## Current Focus

**Immediate**: Finalizing Phase 2 requirements based on user feedback

**Next Steps**:
1. Answer clarifying questions
2. Prioritize features for MVP
3. Create technical specifications
4. Begin implementation with foundation

## Timeline Estimate

**Phase 2 MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- Week 1-2: Multi-list infrastructure
- Week 2-3: Settings system and bulk operations
- Week 4: Enhanced headers and context menu
- Week 5-6: Polish, testing, and description management

## Technical Notes

### Phase 2 Challenges
- Performance with multiple visible lists
- Complex state management across lists
- Maintaining selection state during operations
- Mobile UX for multi-list and bulk operations

### Architecture Considerations
- Intersection Observer for viewport detection
- Per-list virtualization strategy
- Reducer pattern for complex state
- Efficient cross-list updates
