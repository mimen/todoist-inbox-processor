# List View Feature - Stakeholder Questions & Considerations

## Executive Summary

The List View feature will introduce a new way for users to interact with their tasks, providing a comprehensive overview as an alternative to the current single-task processing mode. Before proceeding with implementation, we need clarification on several key decisions that will impact user experience, technical architecture, and project timeline.

## Critical Questions Requiring Immediate Answers

### 1. Default View Preference
**Question**: What should be the default view for users?

**Options**:
- A) Always start in Processing View (current behavior)
- B) Always start in List View
- C) Remember last used view per user
- D) Different defaults for different user segments

**Considerations**:
- New users might find List View less overwhelming
- Existing users expect Processing View
- Mobile users might prefer different default than desktop

**Recommendation**: Option C - Remember last used view in localStorage

---

### 2. Mobile Experience Strategy
**Question**: How should List View behave on mobile devices?

**Options**:
- A) Full feature parity with desktop
- B) Simplified mobile-specific List View
- C) Default to Processing View on mobile
- D) Responsive design that progressively hides columns

**Considerations**:
- Limited screen real estate on mobile
- Touch interactions vs mouse hover
- Performance on lower-end devices

**Recommendation**: Option D with Option C fallback for very small screens

---

### 3. Bulk Actions Scope
**Question**: Which bulk actions are critical for MVP vs future releases?

**MVP Options**:
- Move to project (single project)
- Mark complete
- Change priority
- Add/remove labels

**Future Options**:
- Assign to team member
- Set due dates
- Delete tasks
- Create task templates

**Recommendation**: MVP should include only "Move to project" and "Mark complete"

---

### 4. Data Density Balance
**Question**: How much information should be visible by default in List View?

**Essential Columns**:
- Task content
- Priority
- Project (when not filtered by project)

**Optional Columns**:
- Due date
- Labels
- Assignee
- Creation date
- Description preview

**Recommendation**: Show essential + due date + labels by default, with user customization later

---

### 5. Performance Thresholds
**Question**: At what point should we implement pagination or virtual scrolling?

**Options**:
- A) Always use virtual scrolling
- B) Virtual scrolling only for >100 tasks
- C) Pagination with "Load More" button
- D) Infinite scroll with virtual scrolling

**Considerations**:
- Development complexity
- User experience consistency
- Search/filter functionality

**Recommendation**: Option B - Progressive enhancement based on task count

## Business & Product Questions

### 6. Success Metrics
**Question**: How will we measure the success of List View?

**Proposed Metrics**:
- Adoption rate (% of users who try it)
- Retention rate (% who continue using it)
- Task completion velocity
- User satisfaction scores
- Support ticket reduction

**Need Clarification**: Which metric is the primary KPI?

---

### 7. Integration with Existing Features
**Question**: How should List View interact with existing features?

**Specific Scenarios**:
- Should keyboard shortcuts work identically in both views?
- Should the progress bar show in List View?
- How do task suggestions work in List View?
- Should project metadata display be available?

**Recommendation**: Maintain feature parity where it makes sense, hide processing-specific features

---

### 8. Customization Level
**Question**: How much customization should users have?

**Customization Options**:
- Column visibility
- Sort preferences persistence
- Group by preferences
- Row density (compact/comfortable/spacious)
- Color coding rules

**Recommendation**: Start with sort/group preferences, add column customization in v2

## Technical Decisions

### 9. State Management
**Question**: Should view state be shared or separate?

**Options**:
- A) Completely separate state for each view
- B) Shared task state, separate UI state
- C) Fully shared state with view-specific overrides

**Recommendation**: Option B for easier maintenance and consistency

---

### 10. Animation and Transitions
**Question**: What level of animation is appropriate?

**Areas for Animation**:
- View mode transition
- Task expand/collapse
- Sort reordering
- Complete/delete actions
- Loading states

**Recommendation**: Subtle animations for better UX, with reduced motion option

## User Experience Questions

### 11. Empty States
**Question**: How should empty states differ between views?

**Scenarios**:
- No tasks in queue
- All tasks completed
- No tasks match filter
- Loading failed

**Recommendation**: Context-aware messages that suggest next actions

---

### 12. Error Handling
**Question**: How should errors be displayed in List View?

**Error Types**:
- Individual task update failure
- Bulk action partial failure
- Loading errors
- Real-time sync conflicts

**Recommendation**: Inline error states with retry options

## Timeline & Resource Questions

### 13. Phased Rollout
**Question**: What features are must-have for MVP?

**Proposed MVP**:
- Basic list display
- View toggle
- Context-aware columns
- Simple sorting
- Click to expand

**Proposed Phase 2**:
- Grouping
- Bulk actions
- Keyboard navigation
- Virtual scrolling
- Customization

**Need Confirmation**: Is this phasing acceptable?

---

### 14. Team Resources
**Question**: What resources are available for this feature?

**Required Skills**:
- Frontend development (React)
- UX design
- QA testing
- Product management

**Estimated Effort**:
- MVP: 2-3 weeks with 2 developers
- Full feature: 4-6 weeks

**Need Clarification**: Available team members and timeline constraints

## Risk Mitigation Questions

### 15. Rollback Strategy
**Question**: How do we handle issues post-launch?

**Options**:
- A) Feature flag for instant disable
- B) Gradual rollback to percentage of users
- C) Full code rollback
- D) Hide toggle but keep code

**Recommendation**: Option A with Option B capability

---

### 16. Performance Degradation
**Question**: What's our plan if List View impacts overall app performance?

**Monitoring Points**:
- Page load time
- Memory usage
- API response times
- Client-side rendering time

**Thresholds for Action**:
- >20% increase in load time
- >100MB memory increase  
- <60fps scroll performance

**Need Agreement**: On specific thresholds and action plans

## Next Steps

Based on the answers to these questions, we will:

1. Finalize the technical architecture
2. Create detailed designs for agreed-upon features
3. Set up development environment with feature flags
4. Begin MVP implementation
5. Establish monitoring and success metrics

**Requested Response Timeline**: Please provide feedback on critical questions (1-5) within 2 business days, and remaining questions within 1 week.

## Decision Log Template

For each question, please provide:
- **Decision**: Selected option
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
- **Impact**: How this affects timeline/resources
- **Owner**: Who is responsible for this decision area
