# List View Feature - User Stories

## Epic: List View for Task Processing

### Story 1: View Mode Toggle
**As a** task processor user  
**I want** to toggle between Processing View and List View  
**So that** I can choose the most appropriate interface for my current workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am in the task processor interface, **WHEN** I look at the top controls, **THEN** I see a clearly labeled view toggle (icon + text)
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am in Processing View, **WHEN** I click the List View toggle, **THEN** the interface transitions to List View within 100ms
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am in List View, **WHEN** I click the Processing View toggle, **THEN** the interface returns to single-task processing mode
- [ ] **GIVEN** I have selected a specific queue (e.g., Project X), **WHEN** I toggle views, **THEN** the same queue remains selected
- [ ] **GIVEN** I have applied filters (e.g., assignee filter), **WHEN** I toggle views, **THEN** the filters remain active
- [ ] **GIVEN** I refresh the page, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** my last view preference is restored from localStorage

#### Technical Notes:
- Toggle state stored in localStorage with key `taskProcessor.viewMode`
- Transition should use CSS animations for smooth UX
- Both view modes share the same data source to ensure consistency

### Story 2: Basic List Display
**As a** user in List View  
**I want** to see all tasks in my current queue as a scannable list  
**So that** I can quickly understand my workload

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] **GIVEN** I switch to List View, **WHEN** the view loads, **THEN** I see all tasks from the current queue in a vertical list
- [ ] **GIVEN** each task is displayed, **WHEN** I look at a row, **THEN** I see: task content, priority flag, project indicator, dates, labels, and assignee
- [ ] **GIVEN** a task has a long title, **WHEN** displayed in the list, **THEN** it truncates with "..." and shows full text on hover
- [ ] **GIVEN** I have more than 50 tasks, **WHEN** I scroll, **THEN** the scrolling is smooth and maintains 60fps
- [ ] **GIVEN** tasks have different priorities, **WHEN** displayed, **THEN** priority is shown with colored badge (P1=red, P2=orange, P3=blue, P4=gray)
- [ ] **GIVEN** a task has dates, **WHEN** displayed, **THEN** overdue dates are red, today is orange, future dates are blue

#### Technical Notes:
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive row layout
- Implement intersection observer for performance with large lists
- Memoize task rows to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Story 3: Context-Aware Display
**As a** user viewing tasks in a specific context  
**I want** redundant information automatically hidden  
**So that** I can focus on the unique aspects of each task

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm viewing tasks from a single project, **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** the project name is shown in the header, not on each task
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm viewing tasks by priority (e.g., P1 tasks), **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** tasks don't show individual priority badges
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm viewing tasks with specific labels, **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** the filtered label is highlighted differently from other labels
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm viewing "All Tasks", **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** full context (project, priority, etc.) is shown for each task
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm viewing multiple projects, **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** project names are shown on each task
- [ ] **GIVEN** context changes, **WHEN** the display updates, **THEN** the transition is smooth without layout shift

#### Technical Notes:
- Create a `getVisibleColumns()` function based on current ProcessingMode
- Use CSS classes to show/hide columns rather than conditional rendering
- Header component should display the hidden context information

### Story 4: Task Interaction in List View
**As a** user  
**I want** to interact with tasks directly from the list  
**So that** I can manage tasks efficiently without changing views

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] **GIVEN** I hover over a task row, **WHEN** hovering, **THEN** action buttons appear (Complete, Process, Edit)
- [ ] **GIVEN** I click on a task row, **WHEN** clicked, **THEN** it expands to show the task description
- [ ] **GIVEN** a task is expanded, **WHEN** I click it again, **THEN** it collapses to show only the summary
- [ ] **GIVEN** I click the Complete button, **WHEN** confirmed, **THEN** the task is marked complete and fades out
- [ ] **GIVEN** I click the Process button, **WHEN** clicked, **THEN** it switches to Processing View with that task active
- [ ] **GIVEN** I double-click a task, **WHEN** double-clicked, **THEN** it opens in Processing View

#### Technical Notes:
- Use CSS transitions for expand/collapse animations
- Implement optimistic updates for complete action
- Maintain expanded state in component state (Set of task IDs)

### Story 5: Keyboard Navigation
**As a** power user  
**I want** to navigate and interact with the list using keyboard shortcuts  
**So that** I can work efficiently without using the mouse

- [ ] **GIVEN** I press /, **WHEN** in List View, **THEN** focus moves to search/filter input
- [ ] **GIVEN** I press Escape, **WHEN** a task is expanded, **THEN** it collapses

#### Technical Notes:
- Implement roving tabindex for accessibility
- Visual focus indicator must be clear and follow WCAG guidelines
- Prevent keyboard shortcuts when in edit mode

### Story 6: List Navigation Controls
**As a** user navigating between queues in List View  
**I want** Previous/Next buttons to switch between queue contexts  
**So that** I can browse different task groupings efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm in List View with project queue selected, **WHEN** I click Next, **THEN** it loads the next project's tasks
- [ ] **GIVEN** I'm at the last queue, **WHEN** I look at Next button, **THEN** it's disabled with appropriate styling

### Story 7: Multi-Select Queue Display
**As a** user selecting multiple filter criteria  
**I want** to see all matching tasks in a unified list  
**So that** I can work with related tasks across categories

- [ ] **GIVEN** multi-select is active, **WHEN** I look at the header, **THEN** it shows "3 projects selected" or similar
- [ ] **GIVEN** I deselect one criterion, **WHEN** the list updates, **THEN** related tasks are removed smoothly
- [ ] **GIVEN** no tasks match the criteria, **WHEN** displayed, **THEN** an appropriate empty state is shown

#### Technical Notes:
- Use union logic for multi-select (OR, not AND)
- Group tasks by source when multiple sources selected
- Update header to reflect multi-select state

### Story 8: Sorting and Grouping
**As a** user with many tasks  
**I want** to sort and group tasks in the list  
**So that** I can organize them according to my workflow
