# List View Feature - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the development of the List View feature for the Todoist Inbox Processor. The feature introduces a new viewing mode that displays all tasks in the current queue as a scannable list, complementing the existing single-task processing view.

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks (single developer or small team)
**Total Story Points**: ~107
**MVP Target**: End of Week 2
**Full Feature**: End of Week 4

- Context-aware column visibility
- Inline editing of task content
- Basic sorting (priority, date, alphabetical)
- Expand/collapse descriptions
- Arrow key navigation
- Mobile responsive layout

❌ **Not in MVP**:

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Performance with Large Task Lists**
   - **Risk**: UI becomes sluggish with 500+ tasks
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Implement pagination in MVP (show 100 tasks max)
     - Add virtual scrolling in Week 3
     - Performance testing with 1000+ task datasets
   - **Fallback**: Hard limit at 500 tasks with "Show More" button

2. **State Synchronization Between Views**
   - **Risk**: Data inconsistencies when switching views
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Use single source of truth (masterTasks)
     - Comprehensive integration tests
     - Code review focus on state management
   - **Fallback**: Force refresh on view switch if issues arise

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Poor mobile experience due to information density
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Design mobile layout early (Week 1)
     - Progressive disclosure of information
     - Touch-friendly tap targets
   - **Fallback**: Simplified mobile view with essential columns only

4. **Keyboard Navigation Conflicts**
   - **Risk**: Shortcuts conflict between views or with browser
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Document all shortcuts upfront
     - Test on multiple browsers/OS
     - Consistent modifier key usage
   - **Fallback**: Reduced shortcut set for MVP

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - **Mitigation**: Code splitting, tree shaking, lazy loading
   - **Target**: < 30KB additional JavaScript

2. **Inline Editing UX**
   - **Mitigation**: User testing during Week 2
   - **Fallback**: Click to enter edit mode (like current)

3. **Virtual Scrolling Edge Cases**
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with dynamic heights
   - **Fallback**: Fixed row heights

### Development Principles
1. **Reuse over Rebuild**: Use existing components and logic
2. **Performance First**: Consider performance from the start
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality first, enhance later
4. **Accessibility Always**: Build in accessibility, don't bolt on
5. **Test as You Go**: Write tests alongside implementation

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear path to delivering the List View feature within 4 weeks. The MVP approach ensures users get value quickly while allowing time for polish and optimization. By focusing on the critical path and managing risks proactively, we can deliver a high-quality feature that enhances the task processing experience.

The plan prioritizes:
1. Early user value (MVP by Week 2)
2. Performance from the start
3. Accessibility and mobile experience
4. Comprehensive testing
5. Smooth integration with existing features

Success depends on maintaining focus on the MVP scope, regular testing, and clear communication throughout the development process.
