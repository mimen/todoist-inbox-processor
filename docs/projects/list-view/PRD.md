# Product Requirements Document: List View Feature

## Executive Summary

The List View feature introduces a new viewing mode for the task processor application that replaces the current single-task processing interface with a comprehensive, vertically compact list of all tasks in the current queue. This feature addresses the need for users to get a high-level overview of their tasks, understand task distribution across projects, and navigate more efficiently through their work.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited Visibility**: Users can only see one task at a time, making it difficult to understand the scope and nature of their work queue
2. **Inefficient Context Switching**: When working on related tasks, users must navigate task-by-task without seeing the bigger picture
3. **No Overview Capability**: Users cannot quickly assess task priorities, project distribution, or workload without processing each task individually
4. **Redundant Navigation**: Users who want to browse or review tasks must go through them sequentially

### User Pain Points
- "I need to see all my tasks at once to prioritize my work effectively"
- "I want to quickly scan through tasks in a project without processing each one"
- "It's hard to get a sense of how many high-priority items I have"
- "I wish I could see patterns in my tasks (like multiple tasks for the same project)"

## User Personas

### 1. **The Project Manager - Sarah**
- **Role**: Manages multiple projects with varying priorities
- **Needs**: Quick overview of task distribution across projects, ability to identify bottlenecks
- **Pain Points**: Can't see project workload balance, difficult to reassign or reprioritize in bulk

### 2. **The Individual Contributor - David**
- **Role**: Software developer working on feature implementation
- **Needs**: See all related tasks together, understand dependencies
- **Pain Points**: Processing view doesn't show task relationships, hard to plan work sessions

### 3. **The Executive - Maria**
- **Role**: Department head reviewing team priorities
- **Needs**: High-level view of priority distribution, quick assessment of urgent items
- **Pain Points**: No way to get quick status overview without going through each task

## Use Cases

### UC1: Toggle Between Views
**As a** user  
**I want** to switch between Processing View and List View  
**So that** I can choose the most appropriate view for my current task

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am in Processing View, when I click the view toggle, then the interface switches to List View
- Given I am in List View, when I click the view toggle, then the interface switches to Processing View
- Given I switch views, then my current queue selection and filters are maintained
- Given I switch to List View, then all tasks in the current queue are displayed

### UC2: View Condensed Task List
**As a** user  
**I want** to see all tasks in a compact, scannable format  
**So that** I can quickly understand my workload

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am in List View, then each task shows: content, project, priority, dates, labels, and assignee
- Given tasks are displayed, then each row is visually distinct but compact
- Given I have many tasks, then the list supports smooth scrolling
- Given a task has a long title, then it truncates appropriately with full text on hover

### UC3: Context-Aware Information Display
**As a** user viewing tasks in a specific project  
**I want** redundant information hidden  
**So that** I can focus on relevant task details

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm viewing tasks for a specific project, then the project name is not shown on each task
- Given I'm viewing tasks by priority, then tasks are grouped by priority with clear headers
- Given I'm viewing all tasks, then full context (project, priority, etc.) is shown for each task
- Given I'm viewing tasks with the same label, then that label is highlighted differently

### UC4: Navigate Between Contexts
**As a** user in List View  
**I want** to navigate between different queues/contexts  
**So that** I can browse different task groupings efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I click Previous in List View, then I see the previous queue in the sequence
- Given I click Next in List View, then I see the next queue in the sequence
- Given I'm at the first/last queue, then Previous/Next buttons are disabled appropriately
- Given I navigate queues, then the view remains in List View mode

### UC5: Multi-Select Queue Handling
**As a** user selecting multiple projects or labels  
**I want** to see all matching tasks in one unified list  
**So that** I can work with related tasks across categories

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I select multiple projects, then all tasks from those projects appear in one list
- Given I select multiple labels, then all tasks with any of those labels appear
- Given tasks appear from multiple sources, then they show their full context
- Given the unified list is displayed, then tasks are sorted by a consistent criterion

### UC6: Interact with Tasks in List View
**As a** user  
**I want** to perform basic task actions from the list  
**So that** I can manage tasks without switching views

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I hover over a task, then action buttons appear (complete, edit, move)
- Given I click on a task description area, then it expands to show the full description (hidden by default)
- Given I click complete on a task, then it's marked complete and removed from the list
- Given I make changes, then the list updates in real-time
- Given I click on any task element (project, labels, deadline), then the appropriate overlay opens
- Given I'm editing inline, then all fields are directly editable without leaving the list view
- Given I'm viewing labels, then an "add more labels" button is always visible
