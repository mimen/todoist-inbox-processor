# List View Feature

## Project Overview

The List View feature introduces a new viewing mode for the task processor application that replaces the current single-task processing interface with a comprehensive, vertically compact list of all tasks in the current queue. This feature enables users to get a high-level overview of their tasks, understand task distribution across projects, and navigate more efficiently through their work.
